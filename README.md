Cluster key from Kefi et al. (2016)

14 multiplex clusters were identified which differ from each other in the types of links they are involved in, the pattern of incoming and outgoing links, and the identity of species they interacted with. When the identity of the species interacted with was ignored, the 14 clusters were grouped into 5 "groups of clusters" which are called multiplex functional groups. Those multiplex functional groups can broadly be characterized as...

(1) A group of mobile consumers (clusters 1, 4, 7, 9, 14), mostly carnivores, composed of crabs, sea snails, chitons, starfishes, and birds, most of which consume prey species and often find themselves in competition with others.

(2) A small group of sessile, inedible consumers (anemones; clusters 2 and 8) that eat dead or detached animals or their fragments are the source and target of many competitive links with other sessile species and are key players in the resilience of the community. Their classification into a separate group likely reflects their peculiar life habits (sessile scavengers).

(3) An overall hub of sessile, edible consumers that also facilitate others and are key in the resilience of the community (cluster 5). This group contains two common mussel species that differentiate themselves from the other groups by their involvement in all interaction types and particularly in positive interactions (both incoming and outgoing; Figs 2, S4 and S5), supporting many ecological studies that highlight their role as foundational or engineering species [4,37,38]. They indeed provide habitat and substrate for many other invertebrate species seeking shelter.

(4) A group of sessile primary producers (algae; clusters 3, 11, 12) that compete for space and usually find themselves in competitive loops while being frequently consumed.

(5) Finally, a group of sessile species (clusters 6, 10, 13) that is a mix of algae and barnacles that compete for space with other sessile species while facilitating mobile consumers by creating biotic structure that provides refuges and habitat for other species (for instance, the kelp Lessonia nigrescens facilitates recruitment and provides critical shelter or habitat to diverse species).
